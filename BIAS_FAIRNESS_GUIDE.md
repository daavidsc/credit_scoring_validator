# Bias and Fairness Analysis - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The bias and fairness analysis feature evaluates whether the credit scoring model makes fair and unbiased decisions across different demographic groups. This analysis is crucial for ensuring compliance with fair lending laws and promoting equitable access to financial services.

## What is Bias and Fairness Analysis?

Bias and fairness analysis examines whether a machine learning model treats different demographic groups fairly and consistently. For credit scoring models, this is essential because:

- **Legal Compliance**: Fair lending laws prohibit discrimination based on protected characteristics
- **Ethical AI**: Ensures responsible and equitable use of artificial intelligence
- **Business Risk**: Biased models can lead to legal liability and reputational damage
- **Social Impact**: Promotes equal access to credit and financial opportunities

## How It Works

### 1. Protected Attribute Analysis

The system evaluates fairness across key protected characteristics:

- **Gender**: Male, Female, Non-binary
- **Ethnicity**: Various ethnic backgrounds
- **Nationality**: Different national origins
- **Disability Status**: Disabled vs. non-disabled individuals
- **Marital Status**: Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed

### 2. Fairness Metrics Calculation

For each protected attribute, the system computes:

- **Statistical Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates
- **Equalized Opportunity**: Equal true positive rates across groups
- **Demographic Parity**: Proportional representation in positive outcomes
- **Individual Fairness**: Similar individuals receive similar predictions

### 3. Bias Detection

The analysis identifies various types of bias:

- **Direct Discrimination**: Explicit use of protected attributes
- **Indirect Discrimination**: Proxy discrimination through correlated features
- **Systematic Bias**: Consistent unfair treatment of certain groups
- **Intersectional Bias**: Bias affecting individuals with multiple protected characteristics
