# Consistency Analysis - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The consistency analysis feature evaluates whether the credit scoring model produces identical responses when given the same input data. This analysis helps identify non-deterministic behavior, caching issues, and other sources of inconsistency that could undermine trust in the model's reliability.

## What is Consistency Analysis?

Consistency analysis tests whether a machine learning model produces repeatable, deterministic results when presented with identical inputs. For credit scoring models, this is crucial because:

- **Deterministic Decisions**: Same applicant should always receive the same evaluation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Auditors expect consistent and reproducible model behavior
- **Customer Trust**: Inconsistent scoring erodes confidence in the system
- **System Reliability**: Identifies technical issues like caching problems or race conditions
- **Fair Treatment**: Ensures applicants are evaluated consistently regardless of timing

## How It Works

### 1. Duplicate Input Testing

The system performs consistency testing by:

- **Creating Input Variations**: Same logical data in different formats
- **Multiple API Calls**: Sending identical requests multiple times
- **Response Comparison**: Analyzing differences in model outputs
- **Temporal Testing**: Testing consistency across different time periods
- **Hash-based Tracking**: Using input hashing to ensure exact duplicates

### 2. Consistency Metrics

The analysis evaluates several types of consistency:

- **Exact Match Rate**: Percentage of identical responses for identical inputs
- **Score Variance**: Statistical variation in credit scores for same inputs
- **Decision Consistency**: Whether approve/deny decisions remain stable
- **Confidence Stability**: How much prediction confidence varies
- **Response Time Consistency**: Whether processing time affects results

### 3. Inconsistency Detection

The system identifies various sources of inconsistency:

- **Non-deterministic Algorithms**: Random elements in model architecture
- **Caching Issues**: Stale or corrupted cached responses
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent processing leading to different results
- **System State Dependencies**: Results varying based on system load or state
- **Data Processing Variations**: Inconsistent input preprocessing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Input Hashing Strategy

```python
def hash_input_data(data: dict) -> str:
    # Sort keys for consistent hashing
    sorted_data = {k: data[k] for k in sorted(data.keys())}
    # Convert to JSON with sorted keys
    data_str = json.dumps(sorted_data, sort_keys=True, default=str)
    # Generate MD5 hash

### Statistical Analysis Methods

**Variance Calculation:**
```python
# Calculate score variance for identical inputs

std_deviation = np.std(scores_for_same_input)
coefficient_of_variation = std_deviation / np.mean(scores_for_same_input)
```

**Temporal Consistency:**
```python
# Analyze consistency over time windows
time_windows = group_by_time_period(responses)
consistency_trend = calculate_trend(time_windows)
```
