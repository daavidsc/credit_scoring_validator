# Data Quality Analysis - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The data quality analysis feature evaluates the reliability, completeness, and validity of data used in the credit scoring process. This analysis helps identify data-related issues that could impact model performance, compliance, and decision accuracy.

## What is Data Quality Analysis?

Data quality analysis assesses various dimensions of data integrity and reliability in machine learning systems. For credit scoring models, this is essential because:

- **Decision Accuracy**: Poor data quality leads to incorrect credit decisions
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial regulations require high data quality standards
- **Risk Management**: Data quality issues can introduce hidden risks
- **Model Performance**: Clean, accurate data is fundamental to model effectiveness
- **Customer Experience**: Data errors can result in unfair treatment of applicants

## How It Works

### 1. Data Quality Dimensions

The system evaluates multiple aspects of data quality:

- **Completeness**: Percentage of missing or null values
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of data values and formats
- **Consistency**: Uniformity of data representation and encoding
- **Validity**: Adherence to expected data types and ranges
- **Timeliness**: Freshness and relevance of data
- **Uniqueness**: Absence of duplicate records

### 2. Quality Metrics Calculation

For each API response and dataset, the system computes:

- **Error Rates**: HTTP errors, timeouts, connection failures
- **Response Completeness**: Missing fields in API responses
- **Data Parsing Success**: Successful extraction of structured data
- **Score Validity**: Credit scores within expected ranges
- **Field Population Rates**: Percentage of populated vs. empty fields

### 3. Quality Issue Detection

The analysis identifies various data quality problems:

- **Missing Critical Data**: Empty values for essential fields
- **Invalid Data Formats**: Incorrect data types or structures
- **Inconsistent Encodings**: Mixed representations of the same information
- **Outlier Detection**: Values outside expected statistical ranges
- **System Errors**: API failures and technical issues

## Usage

### As Part of Other Analyses

Data quality analysis is automatically integrated into other analysis modules:

```python
from analysis.data_quality import generate_data_quality_summary

# Used within other analysis functions
def run_accuracy_analysis():
    # ... collect responses ...
    quality_summary = generate_data_quality_summary(responses)
    # Use quality insights to interpret accuracy results
```

### Standalone Quality Assessment

```python
from analysis.data_quality import calculate_error_rates, assess_data_completeness

# Analyze API response quality
responses = load_api_responses()
error_metrics = calculate_error_rates(responses)
completeness_metrics = assess_data_completeness(responses)

# Check quality thresholds
if error_metrics['error_rate'] > 0.05:  # More than 5% errors
    print("High error rate detected - investigate API issues")

if completeness_metrics['completeness_score'] < 0.90:  # Less than 90% complete
    print("Data completeness issues detected")
```
