# Model Drift Analysis - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The model drift analysis feature will monitor and detect changes in the credit scoring model's behavior and performance over time. This analysis helps identify when models need retraining, when data distributions have shifted, and when model performance has degraded.

## What is Model Drift Analysis?

Model drift analysis detects changes in machine learning model behavior that occur over time. For credit scoring models, this is essential because:

- **Performance Degradation**: Models lose accuracy as underlying patterns change
- **Data Distribution Changes**: Population demographics and economic conditions evolve
- **Concept Drift**: The relationship between features and creditworthiness changes
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Models must maintain consistent performance standards
- **Business Impact**: Drift can lead to poor lending decisions and financial losses

## Current Implementation Status

**Note**: The model drift analysis module is currently in placeholder status and requires implementation. This guide outlines the planned functionality and implementation approach.

## Types of Drift (Planned Detection)

### 1. Concept Drift

**Definition**: Changes in the relationship between input features and target outcomes.

**Examples in Credit Scoring:**
- Economic recession changing income-to-creditworthiness relationships
- New regulations affecting lending standards
- Cultural shifts in financial behavior

**Detection Methods:**
- Performance metric monitoring
- Prediction error analysis
- Statistical distribution tests

### 2. Data Drift (Covariate Shift)

**Definition**: Changes in the distribution of input features while relationships remain stable.

**Examples:**
- Demographic shifts in applicant population
- New data sources with different characteristics
- Seasonal variations in application patterns

**Detection Methods:**
- Statistical distance measures (KL divergence, Wasserstein distance)
- Distribution comparison tests (KS test, Mann-Whitney U)
- Feature-wise drift scoring

### 3. Prediction Drift

**Definition**: Changes in the distribution of model predictions over time.

**Examples:**
- Model producing more/fewer approvals than expected
- Credit score distributions shifting
- Confidence level changes

**Detection Methods:**
- Prediction distribution monitoring
- Score range analysis
- Decision rate tracking

    """Calculate various statistical distance measures"""
    
    distances = {}
    
    # Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

        drift_metrics[metric_name] = {
            'current': current_value,
            'baseline': baseline_value,

    monitoring_results['severity_scores'] = calculate_drift_severity(
        data_drift, pred_drift, concept_drift
    )
    
    # Determine if overall drift threshold exceeded

        }
    
    return feature_drift_results
```

## Drift Metrics (Planned)

- Sensitive to both location and shape differences
- Normalized by feature range for comparison

**Jensen-Shannon Divergence:**
- Symmetric measure of distribution similarity
- Range: 0-1 (0 = identical, 1 = completely different)
- Threshold: Typically 0.1-0.2 for significant drift

### 2. Performance Drift Indicators

**Accuracy Degradation:**
```
Drift Score = |Current Accuracy - Baseline Accuracy| / Baseline Accuracy
```

**Prediction Variance:**
```
Variance Drift = |Current Std - Baseline Std| / Baseline Std
```

**Decision Rate Changes:**
```
Rate Drift = |Current Approval Rate - Baseline Approval Rate|
```

### 3. Temporal Drift Patterns

**Gradual Drift:**
- Slow, continuous changes over time
- Often related to economic or demographic trends
- Detected through trend analysis

**Sudden Drift:**
- Abrupt changes in model behavior
